This blog tracks my learning journey with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 

I want to understand the TS syntax, tooling and usage - and get a sense of how TS works under the hood. The end goal is to learn and adopt best practices for TS use in modern web development.

While my initial exploration will be more random, I hope to organize posts into a more structured `#31DaysOfTypeScript` series after  - to help others navigating the same journey.
