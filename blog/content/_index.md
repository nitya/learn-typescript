[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly-typed programming language that builds on JavaScript - it converts to JS and can run anywhere that JS does. Plus, it has great tooling integrations to make the developer experience easier.

This blog documents my learning journey into TypeScript. I have prior experience in Java, JavaScript, C/C++ and other languages but want to revisit TS with a focus on modern web development and cloud integration in mind.

Check out the [About](about) page to track my learning roadmap and resources. I'll document my most recent activity below.
