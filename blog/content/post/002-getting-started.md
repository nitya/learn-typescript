## Getting Started
Before diving into the learning path, I thought it would be good to take a quick look at the official [Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - starting with the [Getting Started](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html) section. 

Here's a summary of what I learned.

## Why TypeScript

`JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language`
This means type mismatch gets exposed as runtime errors. TypeScript adds a _static type checker_ to JavaScript, bringing type safety to JS and allowing us to catch type errors earlier (during transpilation, not runtime).

TypeScript is a superset of JS. 
This means JavaScript code is valid syntax within TypeScript files. You just need to learn about (and use) the right data types to make the code type-safe.
