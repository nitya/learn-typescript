One of my 2021 goals is to get more proficient with using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I started this blog to document my learning journey and I hope you'll join me.

## Why Learn TypeScript?

According to the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) JavaScript remains a popular programming language - but it is not a type-safe language, something that most modern programming languages support. TypeScript builds on JavaScript to add support for [type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript) - and because it converts to JavaScript, TypeScript code can run anywhere that JavaScript currently does.

TypeScript is gaining popularity among developers. It [entered the TIOBE Index at #93](https://jaxenter.com/typescript-tiobe-june-2018-145492.html) in 2018 and is [in the Top 50](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) this year. It [surged in GitHub Octoverse Report rankings](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/12/03/octoverse-2020.aspx) in 2020 and [remains in the Top 10 Redmonk Rankings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2021/08/05/language-rankings-6-21/) in 2021. Plus, there are [over 450K](https://github.com/search?q=language%3ATypeScript) GitHub repositories using TypeScript - giving you plenty of examples and resources to explore.

## How Do I Get Started?

In my case, I am going to start my journey by completing this [free learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) that teaches you syntax and semantics in a 6-hr, 8-module series. The [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) site also has a good _Getting Started_ section with quickstart introductions for diverse backgrounds.

Other resources that have been recommended to me include: [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html), the open-source [Typescript Book](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book) and the [Programming TypeScript](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/) book from O'Reilly.

Until the next post!
