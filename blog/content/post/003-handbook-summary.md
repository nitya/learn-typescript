## The TypeScript Handbook

Before jumping into the [structured learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/), I thought I'd start by reading the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - you can also download it for offline reading in [PDF format](https://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/typescript-handbook.pdf). My notes are based on the version published on `Nov 8, 2011`.
