# Learn TypeScript

Tracking my learning journey with TypeScript. Goals are:
 * Understand TS syntax and tooling
 * Explore TS usage with popular web dev frameworks
 * Understand and adopt TS best practices for modern web dev

The goal is to convert this into a #31DaysOfTypeScript series at some point. For now, I plan to just document my journey as I go so posts may not necessarily form a structured learning journey.

## Blog Setup

The blog is setup using [Hugo]() with the [Cupper theme](). My default setup process is documented in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nitya/51905082cfad7682bdf31bc8a36f5553). The blog is currently hosted on the GitHub pages endpoint for this repo. You can also view it locally as follows (where the `-D` flag also shows posts in draft mode)

```
$ cd docs/
$ hugo server -D
```
